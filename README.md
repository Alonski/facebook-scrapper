# Facebook-Twitter Social Agg

STSA is a site - built using Python 3 and the Bottle Framework - that gets Pages and Posts from Facebook and displays them in different ways.

  - [Run on a remote linux server]
  - Built using Python3 and Bottle Framework
  - Magic

### Version
Need to decide on Version System..

### Tech

STSA uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Bottle] - Simple Python Web Framework!
* [PyCharm] - Awesome Python IDE
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Facebook-SDK] - Used to get API data from Facebook

And of course STSA itself is open source with a public repository [Alon Bukai][alon-repo] and [Avihai Yosef][avihai-repo] on GitHub.

### Installation

STSA requires [Python 3](https://python.org/) to run.

# ####### TODO FIX INSTALLATION!
You need something installed globally:

```sh
$ add how to get this running
```

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

### Bottle and NGINX

More details coming soon.

### Todos

 - Write Tests
 - Add Code Comments
 - Add Night Mode
